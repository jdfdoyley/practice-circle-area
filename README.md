# Circle Area

**Problem:** Write a Python program which accepts the radius of a circle from
the user and compute the area.

## Solution Steps

- STEP 1: What's the formula for calculating the area of a circle?
$$A=\pi{r^2}$$
- STEP 2: Find out if Python has a built-in PI class, method or attribute
- STEP 3: Import math.pi from the built-in Python math module
- STEP 3: Create a variable called radius of type float to store the user input
- STEP 4: Validate user input:
  - if input is invalid (not an interger or floating point), prompt user again
  - if input is valid, proceed to solving the problem
- STEP 5: Create a variable called area of type float to store the results
- STEP 6: Display the results to the user as follows: Area: 321.2
