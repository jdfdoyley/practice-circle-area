# Circle Area

**Problem:** Write a Python program which accepts the radius of a circle from
the user and compute the area.

## Solution Steps

- STEP 1: Find out how to find the area of a circle: $$A=\pi{r^2}$$
- STEP 2: Find out how to get access to PI using Python
- STEP 3: Import PI from the built-in Python math module
- STEP 3: Create variable called radius of type int to store the user input
- STEP 4: Validate that the user input a valid input
- STEP 5: Create a variable of type float to store the result of the computation
- STEP 6: Display the results as follows: Area: 321.2
